---

## Implementation sequence and checkpoints

1. Policies/taxonomy finalized with dual‑admin sign‑off.  
2. Compliance Gate v1 tested with drop/allow metrics.  
3. Descriptors + Ledger v1 validated with hash‑chain.  
4. Dashboard + Routing v1 live with signed notifications.  
5. Compliance profiles and exports tested end‑to‑end.  
6. AI/NLP v1 validated against CTI samples.  
7. Mobile + collaboration enabled with sandbox training.

### Additional Considerations
- Each checkpoint should include audit documentation and reproducible test results.  
- Recruiter‑facing snapshots (screenshots, diagrams) should be generated at each milestone.  
- Legal counsel should review exports before public demos.  
- Performance benchmarks (latency, throughput, accuracy) should be logged and published.

---

## Public‑facing artifacts

- Updated README with diagrams and policy snapshots.  
- Audit snippet pack (ledger sample, affidavit example, routing matrix).  
- Cost sheet (open‑source stack, cloud tiers, monthly run‑rate).  
- Security posture (STIG checklist, MFA/RBAC proof).  
- Public demo (contraband‑free walkthrough from intake → gate → descriptor → routing → affidavit)

### Additional Considerations
- README must highlight privacy‑first, contraband‑free design.  
- Audit snippets should be recruiter‑digestible (one‑page summaries).  
- Cost sheet should emphasize lean, scalable builds using free tiers.  
- Demo should be short, clear, and reproducible with no sensitive data.
