## 📂 Core Features

- **Dual Queues:**  
  - *Low-level alerts* → Dashboard only  
  - *High-level alerts* → Dashboard + real-time email notification  

- **Alert Scope:**  
  Veridion™ detects and triages activity across a wide spectrum of crimes and illegal markets:  
  - **Narcotics:** fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, synthetic opioids, prescription diversion  
  - **Firearms & Weapons:** ghost guns, 3D‑printed firearms, explosives, military‑grade weapons trafficking  
  - **Cybercrime:** ransomware chatter, malware kits, credential dumps, phishing kits, botnet services  
  - **Fraud & Financial Crime:** credit card fraud, identity theft, counterfeit currency, money laundering schemes  
  - **Human Trafficking & Exploitation:** recruitment chatter, illicit service advertisements, trafficking networks  
  - **Counterfeit Goods & Supply Chain Threats:** fake pharmaceuticals, counterfeit electronics, compromised logistics  
  - **Extremism & Terrorism:** propaganda distribution, recruitment forums, illicit funding channels  
  - **Data Breaches & Insider Threats:** stolen databases, insider leak marketplaces, corporate espionage chatter  

  All alerts are metadata‑only—no contraband or PII is ever stored. Synthetic descriptors summarize activity in lawful, forensic‑grade terms.  

- **AI/NLP Engine:** Open-source models for language detection, entity extraction, and predictive routing  
- **Compliance Gate:** Filters by IP, language, geolocation, and content type for lawful metadata capture  
- **Synthetic Descriptors:** Replace raw content with forensic-grade summaries designed for court admissibility  
- **Immutable Ledger:** Append-only, cryptographically signed logs with affidavit generator  
- **Hardened Access:** Dual-admin onboarding, MFA, badge/ID verification, full traceability  
- **Pending Agency Workflow:** Alerts held if agency isn’t onboarded; escalated to federal oversight until complete
