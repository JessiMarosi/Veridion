## 🚀 Strategic Narrative

- **Veridion™ does things better by design:**  
  - Where competitors chase **volume** (Recorded Future, Flashpoint), Veridion enforces **lawful admissibility**.  
  - Where Palantir offers **complex visualization**, Veridion delivers **lightweight, user‑friendly dashboards** investigators can actually use.  
  - Where AuditBoard covers **corporate GRC**, Veridion overlaps with those frameworks but remains **law enforcement‑centric**.  

- **Competitor Weaknesses:**  
  - **Contraband storage** (Recorded Future, Flashpoint, Palantir) → Veridion avoids this entirely.  
  - **Corporate bias** (AuditBoard, Recorded Future) → Veridion is purpose‑built for agencies.  
  - **Complexity & cost** (Palantir) → Veridion is lean, simple, and affordable.  
  - **Limited forensic admissibility** (all competitors) → Veridion guarantees **court‑ready chain‑of‑custody**.  

- **Recruiter‑Ready Pitch:**  
  *“Veridion™ is the only forensic cockpit engineered for lawful admissibility, nationwide routing, and audit‑grade compliance—turning competitor weaknesses into deliberate strengths.”*
